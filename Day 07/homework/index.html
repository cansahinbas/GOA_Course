<h1>Süper Lig</h1>

<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>Football in Turkey stems back to the late 19th century, when Englishmen brought the game with them
while living in Salonica (then part of the Ottoman Empire). The first league competition was the Istanbul
Football League, which took place in the 1904-05 season.<br> The league went through several variations until the 
creation of the Millî Lig (Süper Lig) in 1959. Between the creation of the Istanbul League and Millî Lig,
several other regional leagues took place: Adana (1924), Ankara (1922), Eskişehir (1924), İzmir (1924), Bursa 
(1924), and Trabzon (1922), to name a few.<br> The first competition to bring forth a national champion was the 
former Turkish Football Championship, which began in 1924 and continued until 1951. The championship 
format was based on a knockout competition, contested between the winners of each of the country's top regional 
leagues. The National Division (Turkish: Millî Küme) was the first national league competition in Turkey.<br>
Started in 1937, the National Division consisted of the strongest clubs from the Ankara, Istanbul, and İzmir
leagues. The championship lasted until 1950.</p>
