<h2>History</h2>

<p>The first popular web browser with a graphical user interface, Mosaic, was released in 1993. Accessible
     to non-technical people, it played a prominent role in 
    the rapid growth of the early World Wide Web. The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape
     corporation, which released a more polished browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994. This quickly became the most-used.

    During these formative years of the Web, web pages could only be static, lacking the capability for dynamic behavior after the page was loaded in the browser.
     There was a desire in the flourishing web development scene to remove this limitation, so in 1995, Netscape
      decided to add a programming language to Navigator. They pursued two routes to achieve this: collaborating with Sun
      Microsystems to embed the Java language, while also hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme language.
    
    The goal was a "language for the masses", "to help nonprogrammers create dynamic, interactive Web sites". Netscape management soon decided that the bes
    t option was for Eich to devise a new language, with syntax similar to Java and less like Scheme or other
     extant scripting languages. Although the new language 
    and its interpreter implementation were called LiveScript when first shipped as part of a Navigator
     beta in September 1995, the name was changed to JavaScript for the official release in December.
    The choice of the JavaScript name has caused confusion, implying that it is directly related to Java.
     At the time, the dot-com boom had begun and Java was a popular new language, so Eich considered the JavaScript name a marketing ploy by Netscape.</p>
