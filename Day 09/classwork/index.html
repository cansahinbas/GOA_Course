<h2>History</h2>

<p>The founder and first president of Fenerbahçe, Nurizade Ziya Songülen, was first introduced to the football in England, where he went for 
higher education after graduating from Istanbul Saint-Joseph College in 1903, and was inspired by the football teams in this country, where
the sport of football was born. When he returned to the country in 1906, the first thing he did was to establish a football team in his
hometown, Istanbul in June 1906. He first contacted his friends in the Kadıköy district and then Enver Yetiker, the literature 
teacher at the school he graduated from, and conveyed his intention to establish a football team to them and made them an offer.
Nurizade Ziya Bey, who received a positive response to his offer, initially only went to training with the first Fenerbahçe football
team in history, the prototype of which was created in June 1906. Because the team could only be completed as an 11-person team in the
spring of 1907, the official foundation date of the club.</p>
