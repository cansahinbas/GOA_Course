<h2>Taxonomy</h2>

<P>Dogs are domesticated members of the family Canidae. They are classified as a subspecies of Canis lupus,
<br> along with wolves and dingoes.[5][6] Dogs were domesticated from wolves over 14,000 years ago by hunter-gatherers, before the development of 
<br>  agriculture.[7][8] The remains of the Bonn–Oberkassel dog, buried alongside humans between 14,000 and 15,000 years ago, are the earliest to be
<br>conclusively identified as a domesticated dog.[9][7] Genetic studies show that dogs likely diverged from wolves between 27,000 and 40,000 years
<br> ago.[10] The dingo
<br>  and the related New Guinea singing dog resulted from the geographic isolation and feralization of dogs in Oceania over 8,000 years ago.[11][12]
<br> Dogs, wolves, and dingoes have sometimes been classified as separate species.[6] In 1758, the Swedish 
<br>botanist and zoologist Carl Linnaeus assigned the genus name Canis (which is the Latin word for "dog")[13] to the domestic dog,
<br>the wolf, and the golden jackal in his book, Systema Naturae. He classified the domestic dog as Canis familiaris and, on the next page,
<br>classified the grey wolf as Canis lupus.[2] Linnaeus considered the dog to be a separate species from the wolf because of its upturning 
<br> tail (cauda recurvata in Latin term), which is not found in any other canid.[14] In the 2005 edition of Mammal Species of the World,
<br> mammalogist W. Christopher Wozencraft listed the wolf as a wild subspecies of Canis lupus and proposed two additional subspecies: familiaris, as
<br> named by Linnaeus in 1758, and dingo, named by Meyer in 1793. Wozencraft included hallstromi (the New Guinea singing dog) as another name
<br>(junior synonym) for the dingo. This classification was informed by a 1999 mitochondrial DNA study.[3]
<br> The classification of dingoes is disputed and a political issue in Australia. Classifying dingoes as 
<br>wild dogs simplifies reducing or controlling dingo populations that threaten livestock. Treating dingoes as a separate species allows conservation
<br> programs to protect the dingo population.[15] Dingo classification affects wildlife management policies, legislation, and societal attitudes.[16]
<br> In 2019, a workshop hosted by the IUCN/Species Survival Commission's Canid Specialist Group considered the dingo and the New Guinea singing dog 
<br> to be feral Canis familiaris. Therefore, it did not assess them for the IUCN Red List of threatened species.[17]</P>
